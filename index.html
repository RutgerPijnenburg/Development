                  I also did school research projects one of which (Profielwerkstuk) was my start in coding and also showed that I liked the natural sciences, I made a model to calculate if it was possible to use a railgun to shoot rockets into orbit, to do this I had to code with a program called Coach, This was the first time I had coded anything and it taught me (less than) the basics.
                  This project was also the first time I had to write a report, so I learned some things from it for professional skills.

                At the beginning of the year, I had no clue what I wanted to do with my life, who I was as a designer or what my vision was, so for this year I had to work to find the answer to these questions. I am not done, but it is clearer, I know the general direction I want to work towards, 3D modelling, and also what my passions and drive are, lastly, I also looked at which products inspired me, those being ones that are not locked behind a pay-wall, ones that can be used by everyone. I am not done yet, I have to explore more to further define myself, so that is what I am aiming for next year.

                I wanted to work on aesthetics, so this year I took every opportunity I got to test and experiment with all sorts of methods, I learned various skills along the way, for example during creative electronics I learned how to do basic picture edits while making cover pages, I learned more tricks for Blender, while making all sorts of projects.
                I worked on a number of things in my free time, I experimented mostly with Blender, making things look real, making things look good, or just plain testing how things worked, I followed various tutorials and such to try and improve my skills.
                For the next year I will continue doing things like this, I will keep on experimenting, keep on challinging myself to try and reach higher peaks, I will also enter into competitions to improve even more, lastly I will also start with getting my work out into the world, show what I am doing.

              Business and Entrepreneurship is the area of expertise in which I have done the least, I have gotten the chance to visit Signify during FITD, but I did not gain that much knowledge from this, I have been making a product together and for a stakeholder during Project 1, but this knowledge also does not really qualify as BE. To learn more in this area I will choose Internet of Things, this will allow me to improve a lot in this area.

                The biggest improvement in this area was gotten from the course user centered design, where I got the change to really look into the process of designing for the user, through research, ethics and evaluation I got faced with every question I should ask myself while designing a product. I am not done with this, and my plan is that I develop this area through USE in next year and the exchange in the third year, where I will learn how others are living. The exchange also applies to my identity, where I want to see other perspectives, so experiencing culture shock will help me.

                Math data and computing is important for me, as it is one of the bases I have to use for Blender as all textures and models are mathematic in nature, therefore the courses I have had this year have been of use for me. Both Calculus and Physics gave me new ways to look at numbers all the while improving my skills in handing numbers. Aside from blender it also has been of use in various other programming languages, as well as this portfolio.
                Other then calculations there is also the handling of data, from aggregating to visualizing, this has been very useful as I am now able to crunch large amounts of numbers to make easy to use graphs, to make things clear to others.

                On my previous school I had learned how to handle databases and how to use search queries, this was very useful in projects, however I was missing some parts, I did not know how to reference properly for example, and I got the chance to work on this in various courses. I am not that good at doing research, which is why I want to improve in this in the following projects.

                Technology and realisation is the expertise area which I like to work in the most, from coding, modelling and electronics I like to do them, that is why I want to improve in this area a lot more. In this year I have had various chances to work in this area, I got to work with two of programming languages (java, python) and in the making of this portfolio I got to work with CSS and HTML too. I have done a lot outside of school too, as I have worked a lot on my passion, on 3D modelling for which I have run a lot of tests so I could realize more things, for example, I have improved my rigging skills (bottom right). I had set a couple of goals, a couple for school, and a couple for myself through which I levelled up my abilities. For the next years I wish to continue working on Blender and programming, and challenge myself even more so I may reach a new level.

                Professional skills, specifically communication is the thing I still have to improve in the most, it has been this way for a long time and it still is the case, but I have seen a lot of progress, taking less time to get comfortable enough to talk, voicing my opinion more often and even presenting went better. I am nowhere near done, I am still not able to just present in front of a lot of people and the max amount of people I can present in front of is 4 unacquainted or 7 acquainted, this number has to go up, therefore I will continue improving through pushing my comfort zone, I will do this with the goal I have set for myself, I have to go to at least one activity for my culture association and have at least two conversations there, this will slowly improve my communication.
                I have also improved in writing reflective texts, which was something I had not done before this study, since I kept it all in my head, and reflecting so far has been a help, it helps me learn faster and gives me and setting goals gives me more motivation.

            <div class="Item"><p>For this year I had several goals and I made a lot of progress towards them. My first goal was to improve my communication skills, my plan was to do this by going outside of my comfort zone, to join an association and join activities regularly, and I followed this through, I joined Kinjin, where I joined an activity once a week and this helped me in improving communication, it gave me the chance to talk to new people on a weekly basis and gave me the opportunity to show who I was. <br>
              Another of my goals was to improve in Blender, I had planned to do this by 1, using Blender 3 times a week (30 min sessions) and joining competitions, I somewhat managed to do this first goal, doing way more at times, but none at others, but this second part I did not do at all, this was mostly because of procrastination, therefore I will set a timeframe this time, in one month from writing this I will have found a competition I will enter. I improved a lot in Blender, even though I did not follow my goals to a T, however, I did find that I really cannot trust on school taking me where I want to be, therefore I will have to do more in my own, free time. <br>
              My third goal was to get better at prototyping and I did not set SMART goals, and therefore I had trouble improving, so for next year I make it SMART, I will do one prototype per week.</p></div>

                Talk about Kinjin, Figma, Photoshop workshop, The winter village, Workshop GameDev
                This year I went to a couple of external activities to develop in several expertise areas, some more succesful then others. The biggest of which is a culture association which I am I part of Kinjin; In this association I have been steadily improving my communication skills by talking to all kinds of people, with Kinjin I also got the chance to have a small part in the Tue winter village, where I worked on communication and creativity and aesthetics. I have also gone to various activities to develop creativity and aesthetics and technology and realization, doing stuff like calligraphy, and 3D modelling.
                I have also gone to some workshops, I went to a photoshop workshop, to work on technology and realisation, and the a GameDev workshop, however, I did not learn as much as I wanted from this. I also went to a Figma workshop, this was very useful as it let me develop in creativity and aesthetics and technology and realisation.
                Lastly I also went to a talk about going on an exchange, as I wanted to know how I could prepare, in case I wanted to go on an exchange.
