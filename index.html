              <p>I wanted to work on aesthetics, so this year I took every opportunity I got to test and experiment with all sorts of methods, I learned various skills along the way, for example during creative electronics I learned how to do basic picture edits while making cover pages, I also learned more tricks for Blender, while making all sorts of projects. <br>
                I also worked on a number of things in my free time, I experimented mostly with Blender, making things look real, making things look good, or just plain testing how things worked, I also followed various tutorials and such to try and improve my skills. <br>
                For the next year I will continue doing things like this, I will keep on experimenting, keep on challinging myself to try and reach higher peaks, I will also enter into competitions to improve even more, lastly I will also start with getting my work out into the world, show what I am doing.

            <div class="Item"><p>For this year I had several goals and I made a lot of progress towards them. My first goal was to improve my communication skills, my plan was to do this by going outside of my comfort zone, to join an association and join activities regularly, and I followed this through, I joined Kinjin, where I joined an activity once a week and this helped me in improving communication, it gave me the chance to talk to new people on a weekly basis and gave me the opportunity to show who I was. <br>
              Another of my goals was to improve in Blender, I had planned to do this by 1, using Blender 3 times a week (30 min sessions) and joining competitions, I somewhat managed to do this first goal, doing way more at times, but none at others, but this second part I did not do at all, this was mostly because of procrastination, therefore I will set a timeframe this time, in one month from writing this I will have found a competition I will enter. I improved a lot in Blender, even though I did not follow my goals to a T, however, I did find that I really cannot trust on school taking me where I want to be, therefore I will have to do more in my own, free time. <br>
              My third goal was to get better at prototyping and I did not set SMART goals, and therefore I had trouble improving, so for next year I make it SMART, I will do one prototype per week.</p></div>

              <p class="Future-Title">PDP</p>
              <p>Next year I plan to make my PDP look more visually appealing, since this year it was very boring, just black and white with nothing more then text. furthermore I will try to expand my vision and identity by looking more into who I am and what I like, I got some feedback from earlier poster presentations that gave me good leads to do this.</p>

            <div class="Squad">
              <p class="Future-Title">Squad</p>
              <p>For my squad choices I decided to have Games and play as my first choice, this is because I wanted to work more with learning, as this is a major Interest of mine. I also wanted to work more with 3D-modelling and coding, therefore I wish, if possible to go with the hyperreality theme.</p>

              <p class="Future-Title">Electives</p>
              <p>So far I have mostly improved in technology and realization and creativity and aesthetics, I have also done stuff with the other areas of expertise, but there is one area, business and entrepreneurship, in which I have done next to none. Therefore I plan to choose a USEll, Internet of things, to address this. Furthermore I also plan to take design for games and play to further develop Technology and realization and creativity and aesthetics.</p>

              <p>I am looking to go on an exchange, to do this I still have to do a lot of stuff, I have already started looking into options and at what I want to achieve for the exchange. I want to work more on creativity and aesthetics. I am aware of the deadlines and I will keep researching my options.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="Future-Items">
              <p class="Future-Title">Goals</p>
              <p>I have a couple of goals for the future, my biggest goal is to keep working with blender, to be specific, I want to create a proper character, one which you could see in the likes of a movie. Communication is my next goal, I have to improve, to do this I will keep pushing my comfert zone, keep talking and keep going to events.</p>
